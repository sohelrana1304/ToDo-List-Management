## Project - ToDo List management

### key features
- This project consists of 11 APIs, 3 for Users, 4 for Boards and 4 for Tasks.
- First of all,We need to register/Sign up the user, then verify them via successfull login and then perform a two-step verification by sending them an OTP in their email Id.
- Next step would be to create Board by the authenticated users, the operations they'll be able to perform with their boards are : 
 1) Create Board
 2) Fetch their Boards details nby the board Id
 3) Update Baord
 4) Delete board
 - Final step is to list the tasks by the users itself. They can list their tasks and can work accordingly. There's a status of the task to be added as "Todo", "Doing" or "Done".
    - If the task is in "Todo" status then it can be updated or we can say it is live.
    - Same for the "Doing" status also.
    - But, If the task is in "Done" status, then nothing can be changed or updated on that specific task.
- Used JWT for authentication and authorization, also assigned iat and exp to the JWT token. Sended token to the header as `x-auth-key`.
- Created a branch named `Project/TodoList` and followed all the naming convention in order to convey my work efficiently.
